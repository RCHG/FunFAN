FunFAM: FUNctions in For Aerosol Modelling
==========================================


This is set of modules and **fun**\ ctions used **f**\or **A**\ erosol **M**\ odelling.
Mainly for climate modelling and mainly programmed in Python.
Rather than a full package  that constrains to the user to adopt an specific work-flow, the
idea is to provide functions that can be implemented in other projects
with minimal changes. The common shared set of functions would help
to improve the reproducibility of our scientific results.

The package or set of functions is organized in folders where the
specific goal is described, as well as its requirements in terms of
external libraries.
