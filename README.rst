Info and Motivation
=====================

This is set of modules and functions in python used for the
analysis of aerosols in climate models. Rather than a full package 
that constrains to the user to adopt an specific work-flow, the
idea is to provide functions that can be implemented in other projects
with minimal changes. The common shared set of functions would help
to improve the reproducibility of our scientific results.

The package or set of functions is organized in folders where the
specific goal is described, as well as its requirements in terms of
external libraries.

One of the goals is that the set of functions increase over time.
